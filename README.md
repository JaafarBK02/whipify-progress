# 🚗 Whipify — AI Vehicle Diagnosis Assistant

## 🌟 Overview
Whipify helps drivers understand potential car issues using AI-powered text analysis.  
Drivers simply describe symptoms, and Whipify predicts likely causes to reduce stress and uncertainty before visiting a mechanic.

## 💡 Motivation
This project was born from a deeply personal frustration.
As a student, I’ve been driving my old (and beloved) 2005 Toyota Prius for years, and while I love that car, it constantly surprises me with new mechanical problems. Every time something went wrong, I’d feel anxious and completely lost. I never knew what the issue was, how serious it might be, or how much it could cost.

I’d often call friends who “kinda knew about cars,” or spend hours Googling vague symptoms like “car making weird noise when idle.” The process was frustrating, slow, and unreliable.

That’s when I realized this problem wasn’t just mine, it’s something millions of drivers experience every day. So I decided to build Whipify, an AI assistant that listens to how you describe your car problem and gives you a quick, intelligent breakdown of what might be happening.

My mission with Whipify is simple: make car diagnostics more transparent, accessible, and stress-free for everyone.
