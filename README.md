# 🚗 Whipify — AI Vehicle Diagnosis Assistant

## 🌟 Overview
Whipify helps drivers understand potential car issues using AI-powered text analysis.  
Drivers simply describe symptoms, and Whipify predicts likely causes to reduce stress and uncertainty before visiting a mechanic.

## 💡 Motivation
This project was born from a personal frustration: as a student owning an old(I love this car) 2005 Toyota Prius, I often felt lost and anxious when mechanical problems occurred.  
Whipify turns that real-world pain point into an AI-driven tool that empowers drivers to make informed repair decisions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Scikit-learn, Supabase Functions  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, Streamlit (for demo)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  

## 🔍 Features
- Predicts likely vehicle issues based on user text input  
- Built-in safety filters to avoid misleading responses  
- Beta web demo for closed testing  
- Structured output for explainable results

## 🧱 Architecture

**Pipeline:**  
User Input → Preprocessing → ML Model → Prediction → Streamlit UI

## 🎯 Results & Next Steps
- Beta launched with trusted testers  
- Expanding dataset and refining predictions  
- Planning cost-estimation and transparency modules

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Translating messy real-world language into structured signals  
- Balancing model flexibility with user safety  
- Designing a simple, explainable demo for real users

## 🔒 Access
The demo is currently in **private beta**.
